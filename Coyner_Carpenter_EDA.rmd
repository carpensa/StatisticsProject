Since we divided up the work, we ended up adjusting/cleaning the original data set in our own way.  Aaron was able to track down additional data the effectivley opened up a group that had been collapsed in the original data set.  I adjusted the data by adding additional columns/factors to prepare the data for plotting using *ggplot2()* and other tools. We were both able to replicate similar numbers to what was presented in the study. However, there are some differences between our calculations and the original work as well as differences between ourselves due to our slightly different data cleaning practices.  We will have to reconcile these and will probably end up using a combination of techniques that we each came up with. 

**NOTE:** Our dataset contained collapsed variables. Apparently it was "to protect the identity of those in one of the groups". Luckily, we were able to access the original dataset (of which our dataset was a follow-up) and cross-reference the collapsed variables. The fact that a group was intentionally collapsed, but remained publically available in another data set is quite puzzling. 

# Figure 1  

## Original 

![The age of the child when the parent was first told that the child had ADHD. Data is for children who were between the ages of 2 and 15 when the interview occurred, a subset of the original data.](/Users/scarpenter/Programming/R/StatisticsProject/Figures/Figure1.png)  

## Replication

```{r Figure 1}
# Subset the data
fig1data <- subset(NSCHdata, AGEYR_CHILD >= 2 & AGEYR_CHILD <= 15, select = ADHD_A1_AGE_STD)

over9 <- sum(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD >= 9)/length(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD)*100
under4 <- sum(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD <= 4)/length(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD)*100
age5 <- sum(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD == 5)/length(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD)*100
age6 <- sum(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD == 6)/length(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD)*100
age7<- sum(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD == 7)/length(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD)*100
age8 <- sum(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD == 8)/length(fig1data$ADHD_A1_AGE_STD)*100

slices <- round(c(over9, under4, age5, age6, age7, age8), 1)
colors <- c('lightsteelblue', 'brown4', 'pink4', 'rosybrown3', 'dodgerblue4', 'cornflowerblue')
pieLabels <- c('Aged 9 years and over', 'Aged 4 years and under', 'Aged 5 years', 'Aged 6 years',
               'Aged 7 years', 'Aged 8 years')
pieLabels <- paste(pieLabels, slices)
pieLabels <- paste(pieLabels,"%",sep="")
fig1 <- pie(slices, labels = pieLabels, init.angle = 175, clockwise = T, col = colors)
```

# Figure 2  

## Original 

![The individual whom was first concerned about the child's behavior, attention, or performance, by age. Data is for children who were between the ages of 2 and 15 when the interview occurred, a subset of the original data.](/Users/scarpenter/Programming/R/StatisticsProject/Figures/Figure2.png)  

\pagebreak  


## Replication Attempts

```{r Figure 2}
#Simple percentage 
ggplot(ADHData_clean, aes(x=as.factor(ADHD_A1_4_GROUPS))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(y = "Percent", x = "Individual first concerned")

```

This simple percentage barplot basically replicates the 'All Children diagnosed with ADHD' as seen in the original Figure 2 (dark red). Below is one attempt, of oh so very many, to plot out each group using *position = "dodge"* as well as various other techniques using *aes()*.  

```{r Figure2b}
ggplot(ADHData_clean, aes(x=as.factor(ADHD_A1_4_GROUPS))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge",aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..), fill = ADHD_A1_AGEGROUPS), na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(y = "Percent", x = "Individual first concerned")
```

This figure still needs to be adjusted considerably.  The first issue to address is the percentage values.  The percentages are shown of each age groups contribution to the whole, not within their group.

# Figure 3  

## Original 

![The type of health care provider that first told the parent that their child had ADHD, by age. Data is for children who were between the ages of 2 and 15 when the interview occurred, a subset of the original data.](/Users/scarpenter/Programming/R/StatisticsProject/Figures/Figure3.png)  

## Replication Attempt

```{r Figure 3}
#This is one of the harder plots to replicate. 

#example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16051363/how-to-plot-stacked-proportional-graph
x <- data.frame(id=letters[1:3],val0=1:3,val1=4:6,val2=7:9)
xlong <- plyr::ddply(melt(x, id.vars = 'id'), .(id), mutate, prop = value / sum(value))
ggplot(xlong, aes(x = id, y = prop, fill = variable)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity')


```

The plot created here is an exercise that I worked on to learn how to replicate the type of plot featured in Figure 4. In order to replicate the figure, we'll need to *gather()* our data into long format to use the featured code.  This has posed challenging as the plot is of percentages of each category within the age bracket. This has made plotting the data challenging for two main reasons: calculating percentages of long format data is not immediately intuitive, and many of *ggplot2()'s* built in tools (e.g. facet, facet_wrap) are not set up to show percentages within each subcategory.
